Developed long back in 2015 (so PHP).

3. Add database to local Mysql(can use phpmyadmin)
4. Open personal.php file to get admin access.

##Important

This project is deprecated and was uploaded for code sharing.
Notes folder is ignored as it had copyrighted content(university notes).

You can create Notes folder at root directory with structure
I have added the Notes folder for the sake of architecture.

Code is not very clean as this was a noob project.
The project is live on:
